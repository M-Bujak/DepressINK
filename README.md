DepressINK is the winning entry of the Metaverse Creators 2023 Hackathon organized by DimensionX. It was developed by Mateusz Bujak and Szymon Bia≈Çek. The competition's aim was to develop a VR application that fits any interpretation of the theme "contrast and control." 

In DepressINK, players begin their journey in a world that is bleak sad, and covered in colorless ink. However, the player is not powerless. By finding a magical brush and palette, the player can use it to restore color and life to this world.

As the player progresses, they will witness a striking contrast between the past and present as they bring vibrancy and joy to a once depressing neighborhood.

The project was written in C# using the Unity Engine. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my programming skills, hence it only contains its scripts. The game is available to download for PC from [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/mc-vr-hackathon/rate/1963304).
